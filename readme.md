Welcome everyone :

In order to create this plugin I did follow these steps :

1- I have installed .zip file wordpress project.

2- I have extracted this one in a folder which I named it `plugin` in the htdocs folder in xampp directory.

3- I have linked it with a database in phpMyAdmin `plugin`.

4- Also I have created an admin for this project.

5- "Signal" is a WordPress extension that allows website administrators to collect feedback from users on the site's content, features, and user experience. Users can send signals which are recorded in a database with details such as the user's name, email address, date and time of the signal, and the content of the feedback.

6- The extensions were activated by pressing the "Activate" button.
